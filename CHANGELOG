1.0.0 (2013-03-03)
------------------
* Remove support for browsers, since we only care about Node.js.
* Remove as much code as possible to make a very simple file format for KATT.
  This also means that we don't care about backward compatibility or future
  compatibility with APIary's blueprint format.
* A Blueprint no longer has Sections. Instead it has Operations, where an
  Operation consists of a Request and a Response, i.e. an Operation is what
  was previously called a Resource. The naming is simply changed to better
  reflect KATT's typical use case. Another difference is that a Resource could
  have one request, and one or more responses. An Operation consists of exactly
  one Request and one Response.
* The HOST field is removed.
* The old ACE highlighter is removed to keep the codebase simple.
* JSONSchema validation is removed, since this is better done in other ways.
  We don't want to clutter our .apib files with JSON Schemas since the
  validation can easily be done in other ways.

0.4.2 (2013-03-01)
------------------
* Added explicit support for the HEAD HTTP method. Removed superfluous DELETE HTTP method.

0.4.1 (2013-01-30)
------------------

* Path prefix from "HOST:" is now added to Resource.url. This fixes a regression
  against the old non-PEG.js parser.

0.4.0 (2013-01-10)
------------------

* Regenerated the parser using development version of PEG.js. This leads to ~20%
  performance improvement.
* Use nulls, not empty strings, to mark missing things in JSON.
* Browser version is now downloaded from Amazon S3.

0.3.0 (2012-11-28)
------------------

* Implemented static |fromJSON| method for all AST nodes. This complements
  |toJSON|.

0.2.0 (2012-11-26)
------------------

* Improved performance by 70-80%.
* Fixed project metadata (homepage, copyright).

0.1.1 (2012-11-14)
------------------
