====================================

This is the KATT API blueprint parser test suite. It ensures the parser works
correctly. All tests should always pass on all supported platforms.

Running from a command-line
---------------------------

  1. Make sure you have Node.js and all the development dependencies specified
     in package.js installed.

  2. Run the following command in the parser root directory (one level up from
     this one):

       make test

  3. Watch the tests pass (or fail).
